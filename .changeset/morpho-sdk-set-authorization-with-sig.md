Add offchain `setAuthorizationWithSig` support for Morpho Blue bundled paths and switch entity `buildTx` to accept an array of signatures.

When the client opts into offchain signatures (`supportSignature: true`), `getRequirements()` on the authorization-bearing Blue paths (`borrow`, `withdraw`, `supplyCollateralBorrow`, `repayWithdrawCollateral`, `refinance`) now returns a signable `Requirement` instead of a standalone `setAuthorization` transaction. Signing it yields an `AuthorizationRequirementSignature` that `buildTx` folds into the bundle as a `setAuthorizationWithSig` call, so GeneralAdapter1 is authorized in-bundle with no separate onchain transaction.

**Breaking:** every entity `buildTx` now accepts an array of signatures (`buildTx(signatures?: readonly RequirementSignature[])`) instead of a single optional signature. Pass `buildTx([permitSignature])` where you previously passed `buildTx(permitSignature)`; combine the permit and authorization signatures in the same array for paths that need both (e.g. `supplyCollateralBorrow`). The array is split internally via the new `selectRequirementSignatures` helper (built on the `isPermitSignature` / `isAuthorizationSignature` type guards). `RequirementSignature` is now the discriminated union `PermitRequirementSignature | AuthorizationRequirementSignature`, and `Requirement<T>` is generic over the signature it produces.

**Hardening of the signature array:** `buildTx` now rejects a `signatures` array that carries more than one signature of the same kind, or a signature kind the path does not consume, instead of silently keeping only the first — surfaced as the new `AmbiguousRequirementSignaturesError` / `UnexpectedRequirementSignatureError`. The authorization path is also pinned to the chain's GeneralAdapter1: `getAuthorizationAction(chainId, signature)` now takes the `chainId` and throws `BundlerErrors.UnexpectedSignature` unless `authorized` is exactly GeneralAdapter1, so a bundle can never grant Morpho operator rights to an unintended address.

New public surface: `AuthorizationAction`, `AuthorizationSignatureArgs`, `AuthorizationRequirementSignature`, `PermitRequirementSignature`, `isPermitSignature`, `isAuthorizationSignature`, `selectRequirementSignatures`, `SelectedRequirementSignatures`, `encodeAuthorization`, `getAuthorizationAction` (now `(chainId, signature)`), the `morphoSetAuthorizationWithSig` bundler action, `BundlerErrors.UnexpectedSignature`, `AmbiguousRequirementSignaturesError`, and `UnexpectedRequirementSignatureError`. `getMorphoAuthorizationRequirement` gains a `supportSignature` option.

`@morpho-org/wdk-protocol-lending-morpho-evm` is updated to pass single signatures as arrays to `buildTx` and widens `getBorrowRequirements` to surface the new signable authorization requirement. `MorphoBorrowOptions` gains a `requirementSignature` field, plumbed through `borrow` / `quoteBorrow`, so a signed authorization fetched via `getBorrowRequirements` (when `supportSignature: true`) can be folded into the bundle as `setAuthorizationWithSig` instead of requiring a separate `setAuthorization` transaction.

`@morpho-org/liquidity-sdk-viem` bumps its `@morpho-org/morpho-sdk` peer-dependency range to `^5.0.0` to track the new major (the previous `^3.0.0` range no longer matched the published version).
