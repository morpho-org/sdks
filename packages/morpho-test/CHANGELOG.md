### Patch Changes

- [#862](https://github.com/morpho-org/sdks/pull/862) [`5a39d63`](https://github.com/morpho-org/sdks/commit/5a39d6314afb5a8a236242090ec3c40623aebf57) Thanks [@prd-carapulse](https://github.com/apps/prd-carapulse)! - Fix published CJS/ESM package entrypoint metadata so legacy main/type resolution and conditional exports point at built files.

- Updated dependencies [[`5a39d63`](https://github.com/morpho-org/sdks/commit/5a39d6314afb5a8a236242090ec3c40623aebf57)]:

## 4.0.2

### Patch Changes

- [#712](https://github.com/morpho-org/sdks/pull/712) [`93f0c1a`](https://github.com/morpho-org/sdks/commit/93f0c1a2f923d0047c421049f7ffab8f0d66d0c4) Thanks [@0xbulma](https://github.com/0xbulma)! - Move shared Blue and Midnight SDK primitives to `@morpho-org/morpho-ts`: chain metadata, address/deployment registries, fixed-point math helpers, shared bigint types, typed registry/math errors, `ORACLE_PRICE_SCALE`, `assertNonNegative`, and `_try`.

  Expose shared ABI literals through `@morpho-org/morpho-ts/abis` so root utility imports do not load the ABI table.

  Model addresses as a unified flat Morpho registry so Blue and Midnight addresses live on the same chain entry and resolve through the protocol-agnostic `getChainAddresses`, `getChainAddress`, and `registerCustomAddresses` helpers.

  Keep `@morpho-org/blue-sdk` compatible by re-exporting the extracted chain, address, math, `_try`, and error surfaces from `@morpho-org/morpho-ts`, and remove the now-unused lodash registry merge dependencies from `@morpho-org/blue-sdk`.

  Expose the shared address registry helpers and registry types through `@morpho-org/morpho-sdk` so integrators can import the cross-protocol address surface from the main SDK package.

  Update maintained dependents of `@morpho-org/blue-sdk` and `@morpho-org/morpho-ts`, including peer dependents, so published packages resolve the extracted shared primitives used by the Blue SDK compatibility layer.
