### Minor Changes

- [#752](https://github.com/morpho-org/sdks/pull/752) [`229fa2e`](https://github.com/morpho-org/sdks/commit/229fa2ed33e2a55fc597dca96220ec4666fc481c) Thanks [@prd-carapulse](https://github.com/apps/prd-carapulse)! - Add Morph and MegaETH chain metadata, deployment addresses, deployment block lower bounds, and wrapped-native mappings.

  Patch maintained packages that depend directly on `@morpho-org/blue-sdk` so their latest releases resolve the new address registry.

### Major Changes

- [#681](https://github.com/morpho-org/sdks/pull/681) [`c9796ab`](https://github.com/morpho-org/sdks/commit/c9796ab033c7fe3ac7241542f3b1a85d17e9b987) Thanks [@Foulks-Plb](https://github.com/Foulks-Plb)! - **`blue-sdk`** — Fix `VaultV2._wrap` / `_unwrap` (and everything layered on them: `toAssets`, `toShares`, `maxWithdraw`, plus `previewWithdrawShares` in `deallocation.ts`) overstating assets whenever management or performance fees are pending. The previous math paired **post-accrue** `totalAssets` (from `accrueInterestView`) with **pre-accrue** `totalSupply` (still missing the fee shares the next accrual will mint), overshooting the share price by `~ pendingFeeShares / totalSupply`. Conversions now pair stored `_totalAssets` with stored `totalSupply` — both pre-accrue, internally consistent. Call `AccrualVaultV2.accrueInterest(timestamp)` for post-accrue math; it rolls `_totalAssets` forward and mints pending fee shares into `totalSupply` atomically. `AccrualVaultV2.maxDeposit`'s relative-cap check now reads `_totalAssets` instead of `totalAssets`.

  **Breaking:** `VaultV2.totalAssets` is removed (it always equalled `_totalAssets` after the fix). Read `_totalAssets` instead.

  **`blue-sdk-viem`** — `fetchVaultV2` no longer calls `vault.totalAssets()` (deployless and multicall paths), saving one RPC read per fetch.

  **`morpho-sdk`** — `MorphoVaultV2.deposit` and `MorphoVaultV1.migrateToV2` previously sized `maxSharePrice` from `vaultData.toShares(amount)` directly. With the conversion fix above, that share count is now pre-accrue, so the bound was below the actual onchain share price at execution and every bundled deposit reverted with `SlippageExceeded` (`0x8199f5f3`) inside `GeneralAdapter1`. Both entities now forward-accrue the target VaultV2 by 2h before computing the bound, mirroring `MorphoMarketV1.repay`'s shares-mode pattern.

### Patch Changes

- [#653](https://github.com/morpho-org/sdks/pull/653) [`9dce8b7`](https://github.com/morpho-org/sdks/commit/9dce8b7047266badf7c7c813074a08f51ccb8c0a) Thanks [@Rubilmax](https://github.com/Rubilmax)! - Fix market interest accrual fee-share minting to match Morpho Blue onchain behavior.

- [#648](https://github.com/morpho-org/sdks/pull/648) [`1481e91`](https://github.com/morpho-org/sdks/commit/1481e91fd7e3382145b22d98c5156887c2b6496e) Thanks [@prd-carapulse](https://github.com/apps/prd-carapulse)! - Refresh packages that need a release after direct dependency, peer dependency, or source compatibility changes.

  - Update direct runtime dependency ranges for packages using `@noble/hashes`, `zod`, `@velora-dex/sdk`, `mutative`, `viem-deal`, and `viem-tracer`.
  - Widen React and TypeScript peer ranges in the Wagmi adapters only where the updated development dependencies require it, while preserving the previous lower-bound support.
  - Keep the SDK source compatible with the refreshed toolchain and libraries, including TypeScript 6, `@noble/hashes` 2.x subpath imports, TanStack Query/Wagmi inference changes, and viem error formatting; related tests/assertions were updated to match the refreshed dependencies.
